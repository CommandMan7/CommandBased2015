	gitHub Rules:
		at the end of meetings on saturdays all branches THAT WORK will be merged to main branch and then uploaded
		to individual branches
		
		if there is a branch that is working properly then it is a group decision as to if we make a tag out of that 
		branch so that we can revert back
		
		your branch is your branch you may do what you wish with it. if you do not thing it will work please do not
		merge to main
		
		YOU MUST COMMITE WELL all commits must have good explinations as to what was changes this is the main base of the whole thing
	
		
	Variable Rules:
		all static (non code changing variables) should be what they are about and in caps
		all non-static (code changing variables) should be in caps with a V_[Var name]
		all variables should be inside the RobotMap.java class this is were the variables are for easy access
		to all variables
		PLEASE NAME ALL VARIABLES AS STRAIGHT FORWARD AS POS. (please make the variable names what they are)
		
	comments:
		please comment as well as posible so that anyone can take a look at the code and know what is going on
		josh will also help with the comments for doxygen so that we can have a visual diagram of what goes on
