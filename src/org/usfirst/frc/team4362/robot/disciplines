	gitHub Rules:
		at the end of meetings on saturdays all branches THAT WORK will be merged to main branch and then uploaded
		to individual branches
		
		if there is a branch that is working properly then it is a group decision as to if we make a tag out of that 
		branch so that we can revert back
		
		your branch is your branch you may do what you wish with it. if you do not thing it will work please do not
		merge to main
		
		YOU MUST COMMITE WELL all commits must have good explinations as to what was changes this is the main base of the whole thing
